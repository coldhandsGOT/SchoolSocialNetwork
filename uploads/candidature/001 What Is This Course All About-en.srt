00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:36,080
Hello my name is Mark Budnick and welcome to an introduction to my controllers and the C programming

2
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:36,870
language.

3
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:41,480
I'm a 15 year veteran in the semiconductor industry and presently serve as the computer engineering

4
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:43,950
department chair and Valparaiso University.

5
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:49,550
We have partnered with Texas Instruments to develop his hands on laboratory focused experience to take

6
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:54,920
you through a subset of our sophomore and junior level embedded systems courses step by step.

7
00:00:55,010 --> 00:01:01,790
We will ask the questions students ask such as what is a my controller what is a program what is the

8
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:06,860
central processing unit What does a watchdog timer what is an interrupt what is an analog to digital

9
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:09,190
converter what is a liquid crystal display.

10
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:12,720
And finally how do we put all of this stuff together.

11
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:19,070
This course is meant for individuals who are not familiar with controllers and or the C programming

12
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:25,070
language but any experience you have will help for more knowledgeable individuals.

13
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:31,700
We believe that this course will significantly shorten your learning curve for the MSP 430 my family

14
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:38,120
throughout the course will provide scores of examples showing you how to create your own C programs

15
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:40,620
and code composer studio projects.

16
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:46,280
We work closely with Texas Instruments and elements 14 to create a laboratory kit featuring the to-I

17
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:49,150
MSP 430 as far 69 89.

18
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:52,080
Launch pad development platform with this lab kit.

19
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:57,320
We will show you how to use the most common microcontroller peripherals and provide you code to get

20
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:00,160
these peripherals up and running their course.

21
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:05,180
We use the same mixed mode format that we use in our electoral laboratories here a developer is university

22
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:11,180
and emphasis is placed on enabling students to develop their skills by continually practicing with the

23
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:13,790
tools that real developers use every day.

24
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:18,830
Short videos will kick off each of the sections followed by a step by step instructions to get you up

25
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:19,900
and running.

26
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:21,870
And if you have any questions along the way.

27
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:23,800
Our both systems team will be here to help.

28
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:26,380
That's what we're here for to make you successful.

29
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:28,310
Thanks for watching and make it a great day.
